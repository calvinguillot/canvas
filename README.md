# Canvas

This is a tool for drawing on an HTML5 canvas using [FabricJS](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js). 
Select brush size and colour, then start drawing.

You can clear the drawing board completely, undo the last stroke, or save your image, with the buttons under the colours.

You can find a demo here [Canvas with Fabric](canvaswithfabric.web.app).
